# Better Than TutorTrac

Tasks:
* Need some validation for inserting data: should only be able to create sessions for the current term
* Move the search bar from navbar to view sessions page
* Edit navbar to exclude insert session - instead, the tutor starts a session and adds tutees as they come in
* index page:
    * Add a list-group of possible events for all users?
* Entering sessions:
    * figure out default value of a session if someone doesn't sign out
    * set cookies to expire if tutor never signs out
    * perhaps allow each student to sign out? (Could create sign out buttons as an accordion panel)
    * edit the tutor session submit button so it works properly
    * front end bonus tasks:
        * modify the headings on the newSession panel to match the index page?
        * make the select checkbox on index page larger
* Refactoring tasks:
    * Fix interactions such that find functions return only one value when appropriate (e.g. when searching on unique key)
* Testing:
    * Perhaps someone should be tasked with thinking of edge cases to try on our site

Beta version:
* Implement quick stats based on user type
