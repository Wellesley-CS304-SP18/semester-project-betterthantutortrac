# Better Than TutorTrac

Tasks:
* Create form for tutor to start a tutoring session
    * change student insert session based on tutor set preferences
* Set student log in relative to tutor's set preferences
* Need some validation for inserting data: should only be able to create sessions for the current term
* Move the search bar from navbar to view sessions page
* Edit navbar to exclude insert session - instead, the tutor starts a session and adds tutees as they come in
* Figure out what the default value of a session should be if someone doesn't sign out
* Maybe allow each student to sign out?? (not sure how to implement this. Maybe a part of the 'new session' page?)
